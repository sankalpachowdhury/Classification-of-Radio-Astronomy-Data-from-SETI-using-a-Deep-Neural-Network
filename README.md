SETI Radio Astronomy Data classification


Using Keras with TensorFlow as its backend, I tried to solve an image classification problem. The data we are going to use consists of 2D spectrograms of deep space radio signals collected by the Allen Telescope Array at the SETI Institute. 

This work is based on a paper (https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1902/1902.02426.pdf) "Machine Vision and Deep Learning for Classification of Radio SETI Signals"


 The spectrograms will be treated as images to train an image classification model to classify the signals into one of four classes.
 The problem is solved in several steps.
 Dataset is available at : (http://seti.berkeley.edu/opendata)
 
 
By the end of the project, A CNN will be built and trained from scratch using Keras to classify signals from space.
